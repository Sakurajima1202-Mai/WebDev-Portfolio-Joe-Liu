During the process of establishing this website, I faced many difficulties and challenges.
In the initial stage of dealing with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I didnâ€™t connect the external CSS files to HTML correctly. This made me feel really confused because although I changed the styles in the CSS file, 
there seemed to be no changes on the web page. Finally, I realized that I had forgotten to link the CSS file in the HTML head section. Once I corrected this mistake, everything was as I expected.
The biggest challenge in the process of building a website is how to express my ideas through code. 
I often have creative ideas about the appearance or function of a page, but I don't know how to write the correct grammar to implement them. Through trial and error and continuous learning, I gradually overcame these difficulties.
For example, I want to add the expand/hide function to some text parts. However, I don't know how to write it in JavaScript. 
After searching online, reading tutorials and seeking help from AI tools, I finally understood how to use these functions. And then I tried to code. Finally, although I still experienced a lot of failure, 
I got the thing I wanted. This experience taught me the importance of problem-solving, how to use developer tools, and the help of online resources.
In addition, I have learned how to make my website more interactive by using the animation. Using methods such as "button" can effectively keep the connection between web pages and readers
Establishing this website has taught me a lot. I have learned how to correct mistakes, such as linking CSS to HTML, 
and how to make ideas into code. Some parts are difficult to make, such as hiding and showing text with JavaScript, but I solved this problem with the help of online tools and learning. I also learned to use animations and make websites responsive.
This project helped me improve my coding skills and gave me more confidence.
