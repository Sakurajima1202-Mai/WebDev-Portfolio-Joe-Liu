        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">1. Emphasize</div>
          <div class="answer">
          <p>Before building my website, I observed many other people's websites and found that their websites had a common feature:<mark> they had interactive elements 
            and intuitive elements.</mark> <br>
            For example, the official web of SpaceX is full of interactive elements
            <img src="Images/Spacex.png" alt="example" class="answer img">
            This inspired me. I added many interactive elements and pictures into the design of the planned web to make the website convey information to visitors more clearly
          </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">2. Define</div>
          <div class="answer">I have clarified the purpose of the website: to introduce myself. 
                              Therefore, I need to build the website around this purpose.<br>
                              From the user's perspective, I have learned that users don't like having too many elements on the homepage.
                              Meanwhile, in order for them to know "where they are", I need to create a clean<mark> navigation bar</mark>
                              <img src="Images/NavBar.png" alt="NavBar" class="answer img"></div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">3. Ideate</div>
          <div class="answer">Next, I began to envision how my website should be created. 
            At this point, I didn't explicitly establish a structure. Instead, I remembered the necessary elements and then considered how to implement them. 
            Finally, I decided to use the<mark> button to switch pages</mark> and other methods to achieve the purpose of interactive elements.</div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">4. Prototype</div>
          <div class="answer">I roughly created the basic structure of css, three html (goals, index and design), and Javascript files.<br> 
            I also incorporated the button into the code
          <img src="Images/屏幕截图 2025-06-02 170816.png" alt="button" class="answer img">
          <img src="Images/button.png" alt="button result" class="answer img">
          <br>
          Also, I made much effort on making the website suitable for everyone to watch.<br>
          I used <mark>different fonts and size</mark> to make the letter seem different.<br>
          <img src="Images/fontsize.png" alt="Different font and size" class="answer img"><br>
          <p>And the result can be shown like that👇</p>
          <img src="Images/result.png" alt="result" class="answer img"><br>
           <p>In addition, I added mant photos to make the page seems more <mark>USER-FRIENDLY</mark></p>
          </div>

        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">5. Test</div>
          <div class="answer">After completing these productions, I ran the program and asked my friends and classmates for suggestions. 
            After that, I improved the size and transparency of the font. Then, I added the <mark>background</mark> and <mark>animations</mark>. 
            This is a big challenge for me.
            <br>
            My code for background:
            <img src="Images/background1.png" alt="backgroundcode" class="answer image">
            <img src="Images/background2.png" alt="backgroundresult" class="answer image">
            My code for animations:
            <img src="Images/Ani2.png" alt="animationt" class="answer image">
            <p>These code show the fade-in and upshift animation of the page</p>
            <img src="Images/Animation.png" alt="ani" class="answer image">
            <p>This piece of code defines the step-by-step change process of the animation</p>
          </div>

        <div class="qa-container">
          <div class="design">6. Accessibility Statement</div>
          <div class="answer">I tried my best to highlight the important parts and replaced the questions with pictures to achieve <mark>barrier-free reading</mark>
